# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

Speech emotion recognition  implemented the Convolutional Neural Network to recognize emotion from the audio data files. Furthermore, I have conjointly scrutinized the efficacy of transfer learning for speech emotion recognition employing a pre-trained VGG16 model. Project implementation is carried out on Ryerson
Audio-Visual Database of Emotion Speech and Song dataset named as RAVDESS dataset.
